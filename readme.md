# Bozeman Meetup

## We're building this open source version of meetup.com as a fun way to learn and collaborate.
Join us on [Bozeman Laravel Slack]

## Getting Started
Note: If you don't already, please follow the instructions from the Laravel Documentation to install [Homestead.](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/homestead) 

- Clone this repository on your machine
- Run `composer install`
- Add a file to `database/` called `database.sqlite`
- Duplicate the `env.example` file and change the name to `.env`
- To seed your initial admin user, run `php artisan migrate --seed`
- To generate an app key, run `php artisan key:generate`
- In the terminal, run `npm install && npm run dev`

## Testing
The goal is to create the app using TDD, so any code you write should be tested.
We're always eager to help. If you have questions about anything in this app, reach out.
The tests are set up to use a sqlite :memory: database, so there is no configuration needed.

### To run the test suite
- Open the terminal to the root of the project.
- Type in vendor/bin/phpunit and it should just work.
