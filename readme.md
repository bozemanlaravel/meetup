# Bozeman Meetup

## Were building this open source version of meetup.com as a fun way to learn and collaborate.
Join us on [Bozeman Laravel Slack]

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository on your machine
- Run composer install
- Add a file to `database/` called `database.sqlite`
- Duplicate the `env.example` file and change the name to `.env`
- To seed your initial admin user run php artisan migrate --seed
- In the terminal run `npm install && npm run dev`

## Testing
The goal is to create the app using TDD so any code you write should be tested.
We're always eager to help, if you have questions about anything in this app, reach out.
The tests are set up to use a sqlite :memory: database so there is no configuration needed.

### To run the test suite
- Open the terminal to the root of the project.
- Type in vendor/bin/phpunit and it should just work.
